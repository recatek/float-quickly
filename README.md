# float-quickly

Faster, inline-friendly versions of some libm f32/f64 intrinsics.

These may or may not be faster than the libm crate or your target platform's libm. You should benchmark on your target platform to be certain. Some basic benchmarks are provided in this package, but running your own benchmarks is recommended.
